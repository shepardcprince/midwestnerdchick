After getting my rear end handed to me this last year, I realize that I hadn't kept up with any of my hosting sites or domains, which means I am starting from scratch. So I don't have to deal with this pain ever again, I will be creating my site and hosting it here on Gtihub. Time to see if I remember how to code.
